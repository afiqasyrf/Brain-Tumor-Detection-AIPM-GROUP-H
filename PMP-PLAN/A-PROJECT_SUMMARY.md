# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT

**Project Summary**

One of the top causes of death in both children and adults is brain tumours. Brain tumours account for 25% of all childhood cancer mortality. In addition, medical professionals identify the most effective method for treating brain tumour instances. Our teams will use MATLAB algorithms and MRI images that have undergone the requisite moprhological operations and preprocessing to recognise and differentiate between brain tumours.
