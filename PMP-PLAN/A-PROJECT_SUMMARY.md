# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT

**Project Summary**

One of the top causes of death in both children and adults is brain tumours. Brain tumours account for 25% of all childhood cancer mortality. In addition, medical professionals identify the most effective method for treating brain tumour instances. Our teams will use MATLAB algorithms and MRI images that have undergone the requisite moprhological operations and preprocessing to recognise and differentiate between brain tumours.


**Client: Example SDN BHD**

**Project Name: BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION SYSTEM**

**Team Members:**

+ MUHAMMAD AFIQ ASYRAF BIN ABU SAMAH (B032110033)
+ MUHAMMAD AIMAN BIN REDUAN (B032110509)
+ NUR AFIQAH BINTI ANUAR (B032010114)

**Objectives:**

+ To develop a smart system that use artificial intelligence that can differentiate between normal brain and infected one
+ To develop a system that are able to segment tumor cell in the brain
+ To create a model that can accurately detect the tumor cell in the mri picture
