# Project Management Lifecycle

The project management life cycle is depicted and documented in the form of a Gantt Chart, which allows Your Tumor Corporation project members to adhere to the rules and meet milestones on a regular basis. The project life cycle WBS divides each member's role and work, such as the project manager, into many modules. Based on the WBS, each member has their own duties and responsibilities at each point of the lifecycle.

The project management work breakdown structure (WBS) is depicted in the Gantt Chart below.

The above work breakdown structure (WBS) was designed to map all of the essential activities and build the method that the WBS would manage and approve.

The Brain Tumor Detection System scopes, works around on the ability of the system to differentiate brains with tumor and brains without tumor as well as identify the segement where the tumor is in the brain. For example, will the system be able to differentiate the brains if the normal brain contain other brain disease, will it still detect it as a brain tumor eventhough its not.
