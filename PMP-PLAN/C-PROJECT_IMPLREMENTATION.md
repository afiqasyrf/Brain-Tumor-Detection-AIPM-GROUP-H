# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## C. IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT PLAN
### Deliverables
#### Hardware Requirement
For the hardware, our group uses the laptop which consists of

#### Software Requirement
The project codes is build and executed using MATLAB, the overall system is created as a desktop application and localhost is used as a connection between the system and its database.

### System Outcomes
The system will detect the existence of brain tumor in brains and then it will also disclose its location by identifying the segment of brain of which the tumor is. The inputed MRI image will first be filtered to remove unwanted image noise to make the tumor clearer. Then, a process called bounding box will be bound to tumor to specify its location and size to isolate it from the other part of the brain. It will then outlined and the system will manage to detect it.
