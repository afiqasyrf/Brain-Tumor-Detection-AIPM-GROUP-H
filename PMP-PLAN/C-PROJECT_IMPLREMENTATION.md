# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## C. IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT PLAN
### Deliverables
#### Hardware Requirement
For the hardware, our group uses the laptop which consists of intel core i5 9th gen and RTX 3060 high spec gpu

#### Software Requirement
The project codes is build and executed using MATLAB, the overall system is created as a desktop application and localhost is used as a connection between the system and its database.

#### Intelligent System Architecture:
The proposed deep learning model is using image processing that contain neural networks to learn useful representations of features directly from data

### System Outcomes
The system will detect the existence of brain tumor in brains and then it will also disclose its location by identifying the segment of brain of which the tumor is. The inputed MRI image will first be filtered to remove unwanted image noise to make the tumor clearer. Then, a process called bounding box will be bound to tumor to specify its location and size to isolate it from the other part of the brain. It will then outlined and the system will manage to detect it.
