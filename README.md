# Brain Tumor Detection 

This is a project that can detect and segment a brain tumor in an MRI as accurately as possible with an image processing algorithm and illustrate the importance of this segmentation through a clinical evaluation of the tumor segmentation. This project focused on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as image processing method which is filtering, thresholding, morphological operation and colour image processing. 

The project is created by adhering to the PMP in order to better organise the project's lifecycle. The project is managed using a variety of charting tools, including Gantt charts, milestone charts, and work breakdown structures (WBS).

The PMP-Plan created is merely the result of simulation collaboration with outside organisations.

# Project Management Plan (PMP)

**Project Summary:**

The project objectives and team members are briefly summarised in the project summary.

**Project Planning:**

Creating and maintaining a feasible plan as part of the planning process will guarantee that the project meets the needs of the company. In this phase, a Gantt chart and a work breakdown structure (WBS) are documented.

**Project Implementation:**

The project deliverables, such as the software requirements and the architecture of an intelligent system, are defined during project implementation.

**Project Execution:**

The project execution phase is where the outcome, code components, and technical implementation are specified and documented.

**Project Closing:**

Project Closing denotes the point in the project's lifespan that a closing report and lessons learned report are required.

**Project Presentation:**

The results of this project is demonstrated in the project presentation.
