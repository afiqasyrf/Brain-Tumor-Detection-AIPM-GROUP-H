# Brain Tumor Detection 

This is a project that can detect and segment a brain tumor in an MRI as accurately as possible with an image processing algorithm and illustrate the importance of this segmentation through a clinical evaluation of the tumor segmentation. This project focused on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as image processing method which is filtering, thresholding, morphological operation and colour image processing. 

The project is created by adhering to the PMP in order to better organise the project's lifecycle. The project is managed using a variety of charting tools, including Gantt charts, milestone charts, and work breakdown structures (WBS).

The PMP-Plan created is merely the result of simulation collaboration with outside organisations.
